# CFG_project
Code For Good (CFG) project MIT IAP 2017

In this project, we helped our client Paige Academy to accomplish four tasks:

- Set up computer lab and configure network, printer and remote access
- Develop a web programming project for young kids to learn creating websites
- Develop a story telling program where students can tell a story to and display it as text. They can also edit the text and re-play the text as audio
- Update and beautify Paige Academy website
